# Employee_Salary_Haidar

What needs to be improved in my application development project is the architectural design to apply factory patterns such as using the ORM dapper, or generic pattern. Because it will affect the speed when making requests or getting responses. In addition, it is necessary to do unit testing before deploying on production. A feature that must be added is sending payrolls to employees and automatically making transfers when calculating salaries.
