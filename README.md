# Employee_Salary_Haidar

Question:
If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think the next improvement
that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or an architectural
design.

Answer:
What needs to be improved in my application development project is the architectural design to apply factory patterns such as using the ORM dapper, or generic pattern. Because it will affect the speed when making requests or getting responses. In addition, it is necessary to do unit testing before deploying on production. A feature that must be added is sending payrolls to employees and automatically making transfers when calculating salaries.
